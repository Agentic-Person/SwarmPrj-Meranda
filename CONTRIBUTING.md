## 🎯 Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow the existing code style and formatting
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep components focused and single-purpose

### Component Structure

```typescript
// Component template
import React from 'react';
import { ComponentProps } from './types';

interface Props {
  // Define props here
}

export const ComponentName: React.FC<Props> = ({ prop1, prop2 }) => {
  // Component logic here
  
  return (
    <div className="component-styles">
      {/* JSX here */}
    </div>
  );
};
```

### Styling Guidelines

- Use Tailwind CSS classes for styling
- Follow the cyberpunk theme with purple, cyan, and pink colors
- Use the established spacing system (8px grid)
- Maintain responsive design principles
- Add hover states and transitions for interactive elements

### File Organization

- Keep components in appropriate directories
- Use index files for clean imports
- Separate types into dedicated files
- Keep utility functions in the utils directory

## 🎨 Design Principles

### Cyberpunk Aesthetic
- Maintain the neural network and matrix-inspired background
- Use neon colors: purple (#8B5CF6), cyan (#06B6D4), pink (#EC4899)
- Apply terminal-style fonts for technical elements
- Include subtle animations and glow effects

### User Experience
- Prioritize clarity and usability
- Provide clear feedback for user actions
- Maintain consistent navigation patterns
- Ensure accessibility standards

## 🧪 Testing

- Test all new features thoroughly
- Verify responsive design on different screen sizes
- Check browser compatibility
- Test localStorage persistence
- Validate form inputs and error handling
